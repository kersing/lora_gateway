It is possible to operate the IMST concentrator with USB  connection directly from the USB port of a Mac. However,
there are many pitfalls. Forgetting just one step usually results in nothing working. The tips below are for Yosemite,
based on own experience.

Main steps:
1) Install the FTDI drivers.
2) Install mpsse.
3) Compile the lora_gateway and packet_forwarder with the 'mac' setting.
4) Manually remove Apples FTDI-USB driver

The details.

1) Installing the drivers should not be to great a problem. There are two possible roads
here. One, download and instal from FTDI's website: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
(no experience) or use macports with
$ sudo port install ftdi1

2) You need to download, compile and install mpsse libmpsse, on a suitable place:
$ git clone https://github.com/devttys0/libmpsse

The minimum change you need to make is add #include <stdlib.h> to the support.c file.
Then:
$ ./configure --disable-python

Now, in case you get some errors (most likely) try this:
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/libftdi1" --disable-python

Then (as long as no errors occur)
$ make
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include
$ make install

3) Edit the lora_gateway/libloragw/library.cfg to set the following values:
CFG_SPI= mac
PLATFORM= lorank

and then compile
$ cd lora_gateway
$ make all
$ cd ../packet_forwarder
$ make mac

4) Remove the ancient apple ftdi driver (this step is needed at least after each reboot)
$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext

5) Now you can try to contact the concentrator (connect it!)
$ cd lora_gateway/libloragw
$ ./test_loragw_reg

This should give something like:
+++MATCH+++ reg number 0 read: 0 (0) default: 0 (0)
+++MATCH+++ reg number 1 read: 0 (0) default: 0 (0)
+++MATCH+++ reg number 2 read: 103 (67) default: 103 (67)
+++MATCH+++ reg number 3 read: 0 (0) default: 0 (0)
###MISMATCH### reg number 4 read: 196 (c4) default: 0 (0)
+++MATCH+++ reg number 5 read: 0 (0) default: 0 (0)
+++MATCH+++ reg number 6 read: 0 (0) default: 0 (0)
etc.

If you get
Beginning of test for loragw_reg.c
ERROR: CONCENTRATOR UNCONNECTED
IMPLICIT_PAYLOAD_LENGHT = -472136177 (should be 197)
FRAME_SYNCH_PEAK2_POS = -472136177 (should be 11)
etc

something is still wrong, retry it as root:
$ sudo ./test_loragw_reg

Note that a sleep of your computer may require a reboot and a subsequent unload
of the driver to restore contact to the concentrator.

In you got this far, configure the global and local confs in the polyforwarder directory
(make sure it remains valid jsin!) and fire up the polyforwarder. The standard lora_pkt_fwd
is not suited for ftdi.

$ cd packet_forwarder/poly_pkt_fwd
$ nano global_conf.json
$ nano local_conf.json
$ ./poly_pkt_fwd


Good luck.
